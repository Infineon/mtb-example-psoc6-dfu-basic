# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: basic device firmware upgrade (DFU)

This example demonstrates basic device firmware update (DFU), also known as "bootloading", with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU. This includes downloading an application from a host and installing it in device flash, and then transferring control to that application. This example bundles two applications:

**Bootloader app:** Implements a [DFU middleware library](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/dfu)-based basic bootloader application run by the CM4+ CPU. The bootloader handles image download, verification, and upgrades. When the image is valid, the bootloader lets the CM4 CPU boot the application.

**Blinky app:** This is a tiny application run by the CM4 CPU that blinks an LED at a 5-Hz rate continuously. This application transfers control to the bootloader when the user button is pressed.

**Note:** This example supports only *I2C*, *UART*, and *USB_CDC* for DFU transport currently.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

   **Instructions for using Keil IDE**

   1. To export to Keil IDE, MDK compiler must be installed. See [ModusToolBox&trade user guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/512716/download) chapter **Export to Keil ÂµVision 5** for instructions.

      **Note:** Before running the `make uvision5` command, make sure that `CY_COMPILER_PATH` in Makefile is set to the compiler's *\bin* directory. See [KBA229177](https://community.cypress.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/Managing-the-Makefile-for-ModusToolbox-v2-x-KBA229177/ta-p/250624) to learn how to manage the Makefile.

   2. Generate the *.cyacd2* file in Keil uVision as follows:

      1. On the *Output* tab, append the *.elf* extension to change the name of the executable to generate *\<Application Name>.elf* on build.

      2. On the *User* tab, add post-build instructions to generate the *.cyacd2* file. You can write post-build commands as follows:

          *Post-build command 1*:
       \<Install path of ModusToolbox>/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe --sign {Local Path to \<Application Name>.elf} CRC --output {Local Path to generate \<Application Name>_crc.elf} ;

          *Post-build command 2*:
       \<Install path of ModusToolbox>/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe -P {Local Path to \<Application Name>_crc.elf} --output {Local Path to generate \<Application Name>_crc.cyacd2} ;

          Example:

          *Post-build command 1* (Run#1):

          ```
          C:/Users/<USERNAME>/ModusToolbox/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe --sign C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/blinky_cm4_build/blinky_cm4.elf CRC --output C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/blinky_cm4_build/blinky_cm4_crc.elf ;
          ```
          <br>

          *Post-build command 2* (Run#2):

          ```
          C:/Users/<USERNAME>/ModusToolbox/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe -P C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/blinky_cm4_build/blinky_cm4_crc.elf --output C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/blinky_cm4_build/blinky_cm4_crc.cyacd2 ;
          ```

         **Figure 1. Keil post-build steps**

         ![](images/keil-post-build.png)


   **Instructions for using IAR**

   1. To export to IAR, IAR compiler must be installed. See [ModusToolBox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/512716/download) chapter **Export IAR EWARM** for instructions.

      **Note:** Before running the `make ewarm8` command, make sure that `CY_COMPILER_PATH` in Makefile is set to the compiler's *\bin* directory. See [KBA229177](https://community.cypress.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/Managing-the-Makefile-for-ModusToolbox-v2-x-KBA229177/ta-p/250624) to learn how to manage the Makefile.

   2. Generate the *.cyacd2* file in IAR EW for Arm as follows:

      1. Use **Project** > **Options** > **Linker** > *Output* tab to change the output file extension from *.out* to *.elf*.

      2. Create a *.bat* file in the project directory using any text editor for post-build operation to generate a *.cyacd2* file. You can write the post-build command in a *.bat* file as follows:

         *Post-build command* (Syntax):

         ```
         \<Install path of ModusToolbox>/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe --sign {Local Path to \<Application Name>.elf} CRC --output {Local Path to generate \<Application Name>_crc.elf} && \<Install path of ModusToolbox>/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe -P {Local Path to \<Application Name>_crc.elf} --output {Local Path to generate \<Application Name>_crc.cyacd2}
         ```

         Example:

         *Post-build command* (RUN):

         ```
         C:/Users/<USERNAME>/ModusToolbox/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe --sign C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/Debug/Exe/blinky_cm4.elf CRC --output C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/Debug/Exe/blinky_cm4_crc.elf && C:/Users/<USERNAME>/ModusToolbox/tools_2.2/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe -P C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/Debug/Exe/blinky_cm4_crc.elf --output C:/ModusWorkspace/mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/blinky_cm4/Debug/Exe/blinky_cm4_crc.cyacd2
         ```

      3. On **Project** > **Options** > **Build Actions** tab, select the path to the *.bat* file created for post-build operation, and click **OK**.

         **Figure 2. IAR post-build steps**

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Build and program the bootloader to the board using one of the following:

   **Note:** *I2C* is configured as the default DFU transport. To change the DFU transport, edit the Makefile to set `TRANSPORT_OPT?=<transport>`.

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the bootloader project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target with default DFU transport. You can specify a target, toolchain and transport manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain> TRANSPORT_OPT=<transport>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-BLE TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM TRANSPORT_OPT=UART
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, press the *RESET* button on the board. The bootloader starts automatically and starts blinking the LED. Confirm that the kit LED blinks at approximately 1 Hz.

4. Generate an upgradable application image using one of the following. On a successful build, an *\<APPNAME>.cyacd2* file will be generated.

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the blinky project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Build (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make build` command to build the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make build TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make build TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-BLE TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   **Note:** The application is DFU-transport-agnostic.

   </details>

5. Perform device firmware upgrade using the DFU host tool:

   1. Open the [DFU host tool](https://www.cypress.com/file/504426/download). Connect to the device using the transport configured.

   2. Select *blinky_crc.cyacd2*. By default, it will be generated in the *mtb-example-psoc6-dfu-basic/<blinky_cm4>/build/* directory on a successful build.

   3. Select an appropriate port based on the transport (`TRANSPORT_OPT`) configured in the bootloader. *I2C* is the default transport configuration. Select *400kHz* speed, set address to *12*, and then click **Program**.

   4. Observe the image download progress status on the progress bar, and wait for the download to complete.

      **Note:** See [DFU host tool](https://www.cypress.com/file/504426/download) documentation for further details on selecting a port and configuring it for communication based on the transport enabled in the bootloader.

**Figure 3. Downloading the application using the DFU host tool**

![](images/dfu-operation.png)

After a successful download, the device will boot to *blinky_cm4*. Observe the user LED blinking at 5 Hz.


### Switching between *bootloader* and *application*

Dynamic switching between the bootloader and the application is enabled with user button events. Press the user button to switch to the bootloader while the application is running. Similarly, press the user button to switch to the application while the bootloader is running. Note that a switching request will be honored by the bootloader only if there is a valid application in the memory.

**Note:** Build the App0 and App1 projects with the same toolchain. Application transfer may fail otherwise. Check the **Build Settings** for each project.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

### Overview

This example demonstrates basic device firmware upgrade (DFU) operations based on the [DFU middleware library](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/dfu).


### Bootloader implementation

This bootloader sample implements an immutable bootloader with support for upgrading the application.

The [DFU host tool](https://www.cypress.com/file/504426/download) (typically running on the host PC) sends the application (*\<APPNAME>.cyacd2*) to the device. The bootloader receives the application image in chunks and overwrites the existing application image. See Figure 4 below. If a DFU session is interrupted, the application firmware will not be in a usable state. However, the device can still run the bootloader and perform necessary actions to download and install the application in subsequent DFU sessions.

**Figure 4. DFU design overview**

![](images/dfu-overwrite.png)


### DFU interfaces

The bootloader supports *I2C*, *UART*, and *USB_CDC* interfaces for communicating with the DFU host. The *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS* directory includes all the necessary configurations to select the supported interfaces. See Table below for the default configuration details. These default configurations can be changed according to the use case. However, you must ensure that the configuration of the DFU host tool matches with that of the bootloader.

**DFU transport configurations**

   |DFU transport: I2C| Default |Description     |
   | :--------------- | :------ | :-----|
   | Mode  | Slave | Device acts as a slave|
   | Address | 12  | 7-bit slave device address |
   | Data rate |400 kbps| DFU supports standard data rates from 50 kbps to 1 Mbps|

   <br>

   |DFU transport: UART| Default |Description  |
   | :--------------- | :------ | :-----|
   | Mode | Standard | Standard, SmartCard, and IrDA are supported UART modes in SCB |
   | Baud rate(bps)|115200 | Supports standard baud rates from 19200 to 115200 |
   | Data width| 8 bits| Standard frame |
   | Parity| None | Standard frame |
   | Stop bits| 1 bit | Standard frame |
   | Bit order| LSB first| Standard frame |

   <br>

   |DFU transport: USB_CDC| Default |Description  |
   | :--------------- | :------ | :-----|
   | Endpoints mask | 255 | |
   | Endpoint 1 transfer type | Interrupt | To initiate the transport |
   | Endpoint 2 transfer type | Bulk | To download and verify the binary image |
   | Endpoints buffer management| Manual CPU | USB supports communication using Auto/Manual DMA|
   | Endpoints access type | 8-bit| |

   <br>

### Memory layout

The first 8-KB region of the flash is reserved for the CM0+ CPU. 64 KB is reserved for the bootloader followed by a 128-KB reserved region for future enhancements. Another 64 KB is allocated to the application firmware followed by the reserved region. The size of this Empty/Reserved region depends on the size of the flash available on the selected target device. See respective device datasheets for details. The last 1-KB region of the flash is reserved for bootloader metadata.

To change the memory layout or usage, update the respective target linker script files. The linker scripts can also be modified to define dedicated regions of the memory for each application.

The RAM is shared by the bootloader and the blinky applications, with a common area used by both projects. The RAM regions must be aligned to the 1-KB boundary because they contain the Interrupt Vector Table Remapped at the start.

**Figure 5. DFU memory map**

![](images/dfu-memory-map.png)


### Software reset

When transferring control from one application to another, the recommended method is through a device software reset. This enables each application to initialize device hardware blocks and signal routing from a known state. It is possible to freeze the state of I/O pins so that they are maintained through a software reset. Defined portions of the SRAM are also maintained through a software reset. For more information, see the device-specific Technical Reference Manual.


### Running the code example on a single-CPU device

This code example is designed to run both application and bootloader on the CM4 CPU. The CM0+ CPU is reserved, which runs a tiny pre-built binary that transfers control to the CM4 CPU on every power cycle. For single-CPU devices, you must modify the linker script to exclude the CM0+ binary.
